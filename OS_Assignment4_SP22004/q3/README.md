1. To implement a kernel system call as a module, you will need to follow these steps:

2. Create a new file for your module. This will be a C source file with a name of your choosing, such as "my_syscall.c".

3. Include the necessary header files. You will need to include the "linux/kernel.h" header file to define the types and functions used by the kernel, and the "linux/module.h" header file to define the functions and macros used by kernel modules. You will also need to include the "linux/sched.h" header file to access the fields of the task_struct structure.

4. Define a function for your system call. This function should take as input a pid_t type variable, which will be the pid of the process whose task_struct you want to read. The function should return an integer value indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

5. Use the find_task_by_vpid() function to retrieve a pointer to the task_struct of the specified process. This function takes the pid of the process as an argument and returns a pointer to the corresponding task_struct, or NULL if the process was not found.

6. Access the fields of the task_struct using the appropriate macros. The pid of the process is stored in the "pid" field of the task_struct, the user id is stored in the "uid" field, the process group id is stored in the "pgid" field, and the command path is stored in the "comm" field. You can use these fields to retrieve the information you need.

7. Use the printk() function to print the values of the fields to the kernel log buffer. The printk() function works like printf(), but it is used to print messages to the kernel log buffer instead of to the console.

8. Add a system call wrapper function and a system call table entry. You will need to add a wrapper function for your system call and add an entry for it in the system call table. This will allow your system call to be invoked from user space.

9. Use the module_init() and module_exit() macros to specify the functions to be called when the module is loaded and unloaded. The module_init() macro should be used to specify a function to be called when the module is loaded, and the module_exit() macro should be used to specify a function to be called when the module is unloaded.

10. Build and install the module. Use the makefile provided with your kernel sources to build the module, and then use the insmod or modprobe command to install it.

11. Once your module is loaded, you can invoke your system call from user space using the appropriate system call number. The values of the fields of the task_struct for the specified process will be printed to the kernel log buffer, where you can view them using the dmesg command.
